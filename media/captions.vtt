Let's wander El Nido Palawan!

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Known for its extraordinary natural splendor, coral reefs, and aquamarine waters

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
It is regularly ranked as one of the most beautiful beaches in the world

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The kind of place where you'd want to live on the water

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And you actually can!

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
There's no paradise quite like El Nido in the whole world.
